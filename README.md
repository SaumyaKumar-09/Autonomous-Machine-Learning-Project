# Iris Flower Classification using TPOT

## Project Overview

This project automates the classification of iris flower species using **TPOT**, an AutoML library in Python. The **Iris dataset**, a classic dataset in the machine learning community, consists of measurements for three species of iris flowers: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. 

The dataset contains the following four features:

- **Sepal Length**: Length of the sepal (in cm)
- **Sepal Width**: Width of the sepal (in cm)
- **Petal Length**: Length of the petal (in cm)
- **Petal Width**: Width of the petal (in cm)

The objective of this project is to accurately classify the iris flowers into their respective species based on these features. 

## Tools and Technologies

- **TPOT**: An automated machine learning library that optimizes machine learning pipelines using genetic programming.
- **Scikit-learn**: A powerful library for machine learning that provides various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, and more.
- **Pandas**: A data manipulation and analysis library that is essential for data cleaning and preparation.
- **Matplotlib**: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
- **Seaborn**: A statistical data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive graphics.
